# Supply-Chain

React project for dealing and displaying current and historical company inventory.

Sharing warehouses data via props and manage the state of each warehouse with hooks and class based components.<br />
HTTP requests with the Fetch API to JSON files in the public folder are used as data comming from backend.

##### Development on MAC.
