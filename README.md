# Supply-Chain

REACT project for dealing and dispaly in the UI companies warehuoses and inventory.

## Idea

REACT state object represent the current state of inventory in warehuoses of a company.<br />
Practice in sharing data between components by passing data via props and manage state with hooks and class based components.<br />
JSON files are used as data comming from backend using fetch API request.
<br /> 
The final purpose is to detect incidents when data coming from the external source isn't synchronize and then set alerts.
<br />
Responsive design and state-managment(Redux/MobX) are not in the scope. 


## Visualization

The app development is on a MAC, in PC UI may appear differently.
